# Prebuilt Docker Servers
Dockers that might be useful for servers

| Name | Pulls | Description |
| ---- | -----:| ----------- |
| [Swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/) | | A central repository of REST API's defined in Swagger |
| [List of Caddy Modules](https://caddy.community/t/list-of-caddy-2-modules/7839) | | This list is maintained by the community until the new website supports registering modules. |
| [yannj / Caddy JWT](https://hub.docker.com/r/yannj/caddy-jwt) | üíó50k | Caddy image with jwt, git, cors, realip, expires, cache and cloudflare plugins. Also builder through [github caddy-docker blob](https://github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker/blob/master/BUILDER.md) |
| [alombarte / hugo](https://hub.docker.com/r/alombarte/hugo) | 3.3k | A ready-to-use image to build static sites using Hugo. See [this article](https://medium.com/@alombarte/from-dynamic-to-statically-generated-websites-with-free-hosting-and-ssl-64f072e8c32b) to find out how it works. |
| [Login Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/tarent/loginsrv) | üíó50k | JWT login microservice with plugable backends such as OAuth2, Github, htpasswd, osiam. Loginsrv provides a minimal endpoint for authentication. The login is performed against the providers and returned as Json Web Token. It can be used as: standalone microservice; docker container; golang library; caddyserver plugin. NOTES: internal login service or external with BitBucket, Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, Google  |
| [dojot / Auth](https://hub.docker.com/r/dojot/auth) | 10k | This service handles user authentication for the platform. Namely this is used to maintain the set of known users, and their associated roles. Should a user need to interact with the platform, this service is responsible for generating the JWT token to be used when doing so. NOTES: Runs python and Postgres, but does exactly one thing and apparently does it well. |
| [Stempler / Swagger UI](https://hub.docker.com/r/stempler/swagger-ui) | 9.0k | Swagger UI with JWT support (adapted from schickling/swagger-ui)/ Last updated 4 years ago. |
| [Test Architect](https://hub.docker.com/_/testarchitect) | üíó | TestArchitect automation components to execute web-services tests (written in ABT language). This Docker image allows your web service tests written in Action-Based Testing language to execute within a Docker container. Your webservice under test should live in a separate container interacting with TestArchitect via http requests. NOTE: The web site has an impressive looking test manager UI. Looks good! |
| [Virtualzone / JWT Auth Proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/virtualzone/jwt-auth-proxy) | üíó2.2k | This JWT Auth Proxy is a lightweight authentication proxy written in Go designed for use in Docker/Kubernetes environments. JWT Auth Proxy sits between your frontend and your application's backend, handles authentication, and proxies authenticated requests to your backend. It offers REST APIs and logic for signup (incl. double-opt-in), password reset ("forgot my password") and verified email address change. This way, your application's backend can focus on the actual business logic, while relying on secure authentication having been performed before. |
| [Abiosoft Caddy-Docker](https://github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker) | ‚òÖ686 DH | A Docker image for Caddy. This image includes git, cors, realip, expires, cache and cloudflare plugins. Plugins can be configured via the plugins build arg. Check abiosoft/caddy:builder for generating cross-platform Caddy binaries. A good example of how to use this can be found [here](https://bl.ocks.org/Ocramius/d44b9c500d3fd19e863c621500adeec0) |
| [Aboisoft Caddy-Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/abiosoft/caddy/)üíó | ‚òÖ10M DH | I think this is the most downloaded version |
| [moj / Identity Provider](https://hub.docker.com/r/mojlighetsministeriet/identity-provider) | ‚ùé521 | Handles the management of accounts (with the properties id, email, roles and passwords) and authentication/authorization with JWT tokens. The service is meant to run with Docker and will need an external database service to persist the accounts to. NOTE: This service is still in it's experimental phase - tey it has not been touched for 2 years. |
| [allbinarian / JWT Token Provider](https://hub.docker.com/r/allbinarian/jwt-token-provider) | 437 | Simplistic mongodb-backed JWT token provider with SSL support that handles users and claims.

It includes both HTTP API for generating tokens, a command line util for managing users and claims, and a Docker image build file for easy cloud-deployment. |

It is a JWT Authentication server using email, password, captcha and Google Authenticator. Main Features: Password strengthening using scrypt RFC7914; Password authentication using SRP-6a RFC2945 RFC5054; One time tokens using TOTP RFC4226 RFC6238; Human detection using reCAPTCHA; Authorized using JWT RFC7519. NOTE: This one looks really hard core!  |
| [modalnodes / MN Auth](https://hub.docker.com/r/modalnodes/mn-auth) | 263 | mn-auth is an authentication API image that offers easy integration into other platforms. Specifically it helps keeping the authenitcation complexities in one place and move the core business elsewhere.
