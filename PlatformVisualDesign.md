# Platform Visual Design
How to make your web page look good.

Designing and building a beautiful web page is somewhat of an art. Expressing the design in CSS is more difficult. Having it look nice in all screen sizes and orientations is almost impossible. As a result, most developers (including myself) write ugly web pages.

Fortunately we can just grab a pre-existing design and start developing. The bigger question is how? There are a few ways to do this.

- **CSS Libraries** : the most direct way to apply styling
- **CSS-in-JS** : provide a low level, framework agnostic technique to inject styles into code.
- **Design Systems** : portfolios of controls and styles written for a specific framework or environment.
- **Style Systems** : perform complex high level platform agnostic styling

## The Problem with Styling

CSS was created for a designer mindset and not developers. Most developers have a love/hate relationship with it. While it is powerful, it is also awkward to use, especially with modern web applications.

- CSS is big, really big. Read the specs to find out how big.
- CSS is not scoped, so any rule applies to the whole site.
- CSS is overloaded: it handles styling, layout, animation, effects, screen sizing and more.
- CSS rules have complex priorities. !important
- CSS contains many ugly bits. Clearfix anybody?
- CSS contains ad-hoc hacks to get around obscure problems.
- CSS is often inconsistent and with side-effects.
- CSS file size can exceed the rest of the application!
- CSS can have inconsistent browser support, see [QuirksMode](https://www.quirksmode.org/compatibility.html).
- Browsers default styling is not standardized, see [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

Over the years many work-arounds have been created to get around these problems: [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) to name a few. They work to a point, but they do not solve all of these problems. 

Much to their credit, the CSS2 and CSS3 standards do much to get around many of the original rough spots. Using, for example, **FlexBox** and **Grid** lets the designer/developer avoid a whole lot of pain that would be inflicted by older techniques. The trick is knowing a lot of recipies.

With the growing popularity of javascript-centric web frameworks (e.g. React), **CSS-in-JS** approaches are getting a lot of traction. These are styles written in javascript rather than css. While they seem disliked by many, they do get around some of the issues.

The solution? CSS is here to stay, so adopt a CSS (or CSS-in-JS) library and learn to live with it.

---------------------
## CSS Libraries

Standard CSS libraries are very common. A web search will uncover a great number of these. Here are a few of the more interesting ones. Some of the Design Systems in the next section support CSS too.

CSS libraries
- only style built-in controls (and custom elements),
- might supply much more CSS than you will use.

## Design Systems
Design Systems are pre-packaged libraries of styled controls that can be used immediately with a specific development tool. Sometimes they are created by large companies for branding purposes.

The advantage of Design Systems over CSS libraries is that they can supply complex controls assembled from simpler ones. The drawback is that they can only be used with the frameworks they target - typically React.

A large list can be found at [Awesome Design Systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems). Here are a few picks. The selection and comments are very subjective.

### Legend

Tone: (subjective)
- formal : looks like a sheet of paper, "whiteish"
- business : looks like site for a big company
- neutral : looks like a regular website
- technical : nerdy with lots of graphs and stuff

Functionality:
- standard : the standard set of controls
- advanced : has controls that are uncommon
- charts : supports charts and graphs
- markdown : supports a markdown

--------------------
## CSS in JS
These are mostly framework-agnostic frameworks for injecting CSS into javascript. They do not supply any styles, just the means to create them. Many of the Design Systems use one of these as the underlying styling engine.

See https://styled-system.com/ecosystem for good overview<br>

# Component Structure
Handling of complex control hierarchies

As your project gets bigger, managing the components and all of their subcomponents and dependencies becomes a chore. This might help.
