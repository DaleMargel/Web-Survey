# Platform Repository

A repository stores and versions code. The leader here is [GitHub](https://github.com/). There is also [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://about.gitlab.com/). [This list](https://itsfoss.com/github-alternatives/) has some more alternatives.

Since Visual Studio Code has built-in Git support, we will use GitHub. Any of the other GIT solutions would also be fine.
