| [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) |  Freemium|"A fully-featured, extensible, free IDE for creating modern applications for Android, iOS, Windows, as well as web applications and cloud services." |
| [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/) | FREE | "The Eclipse IDE is famous for our Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but we have a number of pretty cool IDEs, including our C/C++ IDE, JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, PHP IDE, and more.

| [Eclipse Thiea](Thiea.md) ⚑ | FREE | An interesting approach to IDE's. It is a tool for writing IDE's. I plan to look into this one. |
| [Komodo IDE](https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-edit/) | Freemium | "Komodo IDE provides more robust functionality such as debugging, unit testing, code refactoring and code profiling." |
| [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) | Paid | Looks similar to VSCode but more like an editor than and IDE. |
| [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html) | FREE | "Bluefish is a powerful editor targeted towards programmers and webdevelopers, with many options to write websites, scripts and programming code. Bluefish supports many programming and markup languages." |

My preferred IDE is Visual Studio Code.
- It has hundreds of plugins that let you do anything.
- It runs on any desktop operating system.
- It is easy and fun to use
- It is free and open source.

I also recommend Eclipse, but most of these IDE's are quite good.
