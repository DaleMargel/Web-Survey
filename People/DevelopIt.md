# DevelopIt
Rendering Engine person of interest

Jason Miller is a fellow Canadian developer who owns [DevelopIt](https://github.com/developit), a rambling GitHub with 330 repositories. Jason is well known for his creation of [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs). I also like [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm) and many [good articles](https://jasonformat.com/enabling-modern-js-on-npm/). These are all on different sites, so lets sort them out.

- [The Preact Web Site](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Jason's Preact Github](https://github.com/preactjs)
- [Jason's Personal Github](https://github.com/developit)
- [Jason's Blog Site](https://jasonformat.com/)
