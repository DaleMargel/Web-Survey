| [Arc](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc)ðŸ’— | â˜…2.5k| React front end starter kit based on the Atomic Design methodology, which is a nice technique for organizing controls.

| [nod](https://github.com/diegohaz/nod) | â˜…351 | NodeJS module generator/boilerplate. This appears to be mostly services setup. There is really is not a front end nor a back end. The services it sets up are: [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (building), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) (testing/Facebook), [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://flowtype.org/) (code style), [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) (static type checker/Facebook), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (checks on push/pull), [Documentation](http://documentation.js.org/), [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) (version control), [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (git hooks) |
| [Styled Theme](https://github.com/diegohaz/styled-theme)ðŸ’—  | â˜…179 | Extensible theming system for [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). It supplied a default theme to get things started. You can define more as needed. |

| [Waterfall Grid](https://github.com/diegohaz/waterfall-grid) | â˜…6 | Wraps **masonry** [Waterfall.js](https://github.com/raphamorim/waterfall.js) library. Waterfall is 100 lines long, really nice! |
| [Arc Fullstack](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc-fullstack)ðŸ’— | â˜…3 | Arc is a React starter kit based on the Atomic Design methodology. It's progressive, which means that you can start with the basic boilerplate and try the other features when you are comfortable. The example web site is sort of bloated, but it nicely builds up what it needs based on an Atom / Molecule / Organic / Page metaphor. I like the approach, but I could do with a bit less code formalization. |
