# Wish List
There is a universe of different ways to build software. Lets list the features of an ideal development environment. For most developers, this list should be self-evident. Adjust as needed.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Universal | Write once, run anywhere: Desktop / Mobile / Web |
| Inexpensive | The tools are free or cost little. |
| Mimimal | The tools require minimum coding. |
| Lean | The underlying technology does not add too much size. |
| Simple | The tools are simple to set up and use. |
| Familiar | The tools use well known languages and paradigms. |
| Popular | The tools are popular enough to be well supported. |
| Scalable | The end product can scale to handle industrial loads. |
| Supported | Community or commercial support is available. |
| Rational | Dead platforms (e.g., [IE](https://death-to-ie11.com/)) are not explicitly supported. |
