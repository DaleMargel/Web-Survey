# MDX etc
In reading about styled systems, MDX came up a lot. MDX is Markdown + React. It is a minimalist way to create documentation, pages, slides etc with working code on it. Most of these were located through [MDX Specifications](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification#related) in conjunction with the main MDX site.

| Product | Stars | Description |
| ------- | -----:| ----------- |
| [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) | ★43.3k | Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and applications. <br>**VERDICT:** It looks like an application that runs on the client without a server. Works well with MDX. **NOT IMPRESSED** - I gave it a try and watched it generate a simple 500b HTML file and about 230kb of client bloat that did nothing at all! |
| [docz](https://www.docz.site/) | ★18.3k | A MDX documentation editor for React applications |
| [MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) | ★9.0k | for slide show powered by MDX |
| [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) | ★8.5k | is an file format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. Uses [rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) |
| [ok-mdx](https://github.com/jxnblk/ok-mdx) | ★653 | an mdx editor in browser |
| [MDX Blocks](https://mdx-blocks.netlify.com/) | ★155 | A MDX page builder |
| [react patterns](https://jxnblk.com/blog/defining-component-apis-in-react/) | | **Defining Components APIs in React** (2018.07.08). This is a really good overview on how to use React. It was written by the author of MDX-Deck (above) |
