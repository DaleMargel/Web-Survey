# Domain Model
What does the application do?<br>
How does the application do it?


The domain model describes the things that the application works with. If it is a school system, the domain will contain objects representing students, classes, grades, etc. If it is a store, it will contain objects representing inventory, shopping carts, payment, etc.

The domain model describes what the application does and how it works. It also informs the technical architecture as well as hardware and hosting choices. Having a domain model is always a good idea.

Many systems are built without a domain model.
- Some teams do not know how to model.
- Small projects may not need one.
- Modern agile / scrum approaches do not encourage models.

Developers commonly skip the modelling the domain because they feel that they understand it well enough to simply start writing the code. Please do not do this. I have seen too many poorly designed systems in the wild.

## Why you need a model
Most applications have a lot of interlocking parts that must work together. Assembling these parts without a plan will result in sub-par results.

Agile makes the claim that code is malleable and can realize the design incrementally. This is only partially correct. Models are more flexible than code. Models are built wholistically, considering all known features. In contrast, Agile projects build the model one feature at a time. They eventually arrive at a model, but it takes more work.

Would you build a house without a plan? If it is a dog house then no plan is needed. If you are building a [Marina Bay Sands](https://www.marinabaysands.com/) hotel, then you absolutely need a design and some careful engineering. Software is not that different.

A the domain object model need not be detailed nor comprehensive. For iterative approaches, the model should be light and minimal. It is only a starting point that shows the basic outline of how the system will eventually look.

Here is one technique for creating a domain model. It is a bit old-school, but it works. Feel free to scale it down if you want.

## Context
List all the types of users of the system. List external systems that exchange data with the system. This is a [UML Context Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram). It sets the universe in which the system will operate.

Be sure to consider:
- Administrators that monitor the system
- Support people that backup data and perform diagnostic work
- Search engines that catalog the site (SEO)
- External data sources and services (e.g. maps, payment)
- Hackers ??

## Stories
Stories can be found by looking at each actor and thinking about what they need from the system. There is a lot of good books on stories and scrum. We will not be using it for our initial model.

## Use Cases
This is where the old-school comes in. Look at each Actor and determine what are it's goals. Each goal is a Use Case. Look at each Use Case and determine how to meet this goal under a set of circumstances. These are Scenarios.

- **Main Scenario** : This is the scenario that best describes the most typical sequence of steps for the Use Case.

- **Extensions** : Look at each step and determine common ways that it might fail. Then think of steps that would recover from the failure. Sometimes the failure can be overcome, sometimes reducing the damage is all that can be done.

- **Variations** : Look at the use cases for situations where there are multiple options. For instance, payment by credit card or by PayPal. These are variations and they will have different steps associated with them.

- **Sub Scenarios** : Factor out repeated bits into their own sub units.

The trick here is knowing when to stop. Add enough detail that you have covered all of the difficult cases. For tools, any text editor will do.

## Sequence Diagrams
Look through the scenarios. Locate the nouns and verbs. The nouns are canditate objects; the verbs can become methods on the object that receives the request. Build a [UML Sequence Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram) for each scenario. 

Check:
- All of the actors initiate use cases.
- All external systems are included in sequences.
- Applicable relationships are known or can be discovered*.

*This means that if object A calls method on object B, then A knows about B or has a way of discovering it.

## Domain Object Model
At this point, a [UML Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram) can be easily derived from the sequence diagram. Many good tools can do this for you. The model should be technology agnostic. Apply design patterns to make the model more aligned to the technology you will be using. 

From here:
- Create initial data model from the object model.
- Create initial code stubs from object model.

There are tools that can automate this.

## Test Cases
- Test cases can be mostly copied from the use cases. 
- Add unit tests based on what is coded.
- Add a unit test for each edge case.

Additional tests can be derived from these models

- Verify code syntax : compiler
- Verify code semantics : lint
- Verify code supports design : unit tests
- Verify design supports architecture : integration tests
- Verify architecture supports requirements : user / end-to-end tests

## Move On
At this point fill in the methods / code and you will have a starting point for the project. Have fun!

# UML Modelling tools
This list gives some free-ish [UML Modelling tools](https://www.guru99.com/best-uml-tools.html). 
- Lists are easy to find. 
- Excluded tools with limited free versions, dead links, or limited platforms.
- General diagramming tools excluded, you need smart models!
- Have included Sparx because I used it for serious work, but it costs.

| UML Tool | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Sparx](https://sparxsystems.com/)ðŸ’— | I have a lot of good experience with this tool. It is very complete but costs money. |
| [Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/)âš‘ | "Eclipse Papyrus is an industrial-grade open source Model-Based Engineering tool. Eclipse Papyrus has notably been used successfuly in industrial projects and is the base platform for several industrial modeling tools." I think this looks excellent, but I worry it might be too high-end for most. |
| [UML Designer](http://www.umldesigner.org/)âš‘ | This is an open source tool based on Eclipse and appears to have many of the high end features of Sparx. |
| [BoUML](https://www.bouml.fr/)âš‘ | Looks complete. Based on Qt. |
| [Model IO](https://www.modelio.org/) | Looks full featured |
| [Model Sphere](http://www.modelsphere.com/org/) | Looks full featured. Primarly windows, but possibly others |
| [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/) | Has a tool available for Visual Studio Code. It works like markdown for UML so you will have to learn a lot of syntax. I do not particularly recommend this approach. |
| [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/solution/freeumltool/) | This links to a community edition. "A full-featured, free UML software for visual modeling with UML 2.x diagrams". |
