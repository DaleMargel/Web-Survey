# DiegoHaz
React and Styling person of interest

[diegohaz](https://github.com/diegohaz) seems to have some really excellent REACT githubs that deserve more stars. Of Note, he seems to like [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) (see CSS in JS section) which is the most popular way of formatting CSS.

| Package | Stars | Description |
| ------- | -----:| ----------- |
| [Arc](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc)💗 | ★2.5k| React front end starter kit based on the Atomic Design methodology, which is a nice technique for organizing controls. It uses React, [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), Webpack, [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) and optionally,   | [Redux](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/tree/redux), and SSR |
| [Generact](https://github.com/diegohaz/generact) | ★1.4k | Tool for generating React components by replicating your own. Basically automated copy/paste. |
| [Rest](https://github.com/diegohaz/rest) | ★1.3k | REST API generator with Node.js, Express and Mongoose. Suppoprts ES6! user login, social login, password reset, listing querystrings, unit tests, integration tests, coverage tests, continuous integration, documentation generator. The code is mostly 4 years old and it looks like the author has sort of abandoned it. |
| [awesome-react](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context) | ★815 | Curated list of stuff related to the new React Context API |
| [styled-tools](https://github.com/diegohaz/styled-tools)💗 | ★714 | Useful interpolated functions for styled-components, emotion, JSS and other CSS-in-JS libraries. It adds conditionals etc. |
| [nod](https://github.com/diegohaz/nod) | ★347 | NodeJS module generator/boilerplate. This appears to be mosly services setup. There is really is not a front end nor a back end. The services it sets up are: [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (building), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) (testing/Facebook), [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://flowtype.org/) (code style), [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) (static type checker/Facebook), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (checks on push/pull), [Documentation](http://documentation.js.org/), [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) (version control), [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (git hooks) |
| [StyledTheme](https://github.com/diegohaz/styled-theme)💗  | ★177 | Extensible theming system for [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). It supplied a default theme to get things started. You can define more as needed. |
| [querymen](https://github.com/diegohaz/querymen) | ★107 | Querystring parser middleware for MongoDB, Express and Nodejs. Converts rest query to mongodb. |
| [Social Login](https://github.com/diegohaz/redux-saga-social-login) | ★28 | Facebook/Google login implementation with redux-saga |
| [Rest Example](https://github.com/diegohaz/generator-rest-example) 💗| ★14 | A fully commented RESTful API example generated with [generator-rest](https://github.com/diegohaz/generator-rest) AKA [rest](https://github.com/diegohaz/rest). It uses AFA(test),unit tests, integration tests, coverage tests, lint, dev,prod, build and docs. It appears to support social login (facebook), mongoose, express, and a really formalized model using controller, model and router for each business entity. |
| [Waterfall Grid](https://github.com/diegohaz/waterfall-grid) | ★6 | Wraps **masonry** [Waterfall.js](https://github.com/raphamorim/waterfall.js) library. Waterfall is 100 lines long, really nice! |
| [Arc Fullstack](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc-fullstack)💗 | ★3 | ARc is a React starter kit based on the Atomic Design methodology. It's progressive, which means that you can start with the basic boilerplate and try the other features when you are comfortable. The example web site is sort of bloated, but it nicely builds up what it needs based on an Atom / Molecule / Organic / Page metaphor. I like the approach, but I could do with a bit less code formalization. |
| [GeMotion](https://github.com/diegohaz/gemotion-web) | ★0 | Looks a lot like a variation of Arc. |
| [welcome-ui](https://github.com/diegohaz/welcome-ui) ❎ | ★0 | Customizable design system of @WTTJ with react • styled-components • styled-system • reakit **WOW**: has styled components as good as any that I have seen - and a very complete set too! The main web page is excellent and even has theming built in to it! **UNFORTUNATELY** I was unable to get the web page to run; the compile times are really bad; and the node_modules directory looks too bloated for a simple style library. So, while it has a lot of nice formatting in it, I do not like it because it is way too heavy for my liking. |
